# tool-derive
<p>A Perl script to replace specific words in directory names, filenames and their contents for a specific directory and its contents</p>

<p>It also replaces uppercased or lowercased words. I've mostly used this stuff to derive new projects from another one.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

$ perl derive.pl [REPLACE_STRING] [SOURCE_STRING]
